/// https://leetcode.com/problems/maximum-subarray/
///
/// Given an integer array `nums`,
/// find the contiguous subarray (containing at least one number) which has the largest sum and return its sum.
///
/// # Follow up
///
/// If you have figured out the O(n) solution,
/// try coding another solution using the divide and conquer approach, which is more subtle.
///
/// # Example
///
/// > Input: [-2, 1, -3, 4, -1, 2, 1, -5, 4],
/// > Output: 6
/// > Explanation: [4, -1, 2, 1] has the largest sum = 6.
