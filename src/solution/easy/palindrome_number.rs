/// https://leetcode.com/problems/palindrome-number/
///
/// Determine whether an integer is a palindrome.
/// An integer is a palindrome when it reads the same backward as forward.
///
/// # Follow up
///
/// Could you solve it without converting the integer to a string?
///
/// # Example
///
/// > Input: 121
/// > Output: true
///
/// > Input: -121
/// > Output: false
/// > Explanation: From left to right, it reads -121. From right to left, it becomes 121-.
/// > Therefore it is not a palindrome.
///
/// > Input: 10
/// > Output: false
/// > Explanation: Reads 01 from right to left. Therefore it is not a palindrome.
